### Purpose of This Repository

Armbian's automation infrastructure builds OS images on a **stable (quarterly)**, **rolling (daily)**, and **community (weekly)** schedule. It maintains up-to-date [**package repositories**](https://apt.armbian.com) for keeping your system updated and an [**artifacts cache**](https://github.com/orgs/armbian/packages) to ensure fast and reliable rebuilds. 

The system also synchronizes [**3rd-party applications**](external/) with Armbian repositories, overrides Snap-based browsers with higher-epoch native packages, and performs **automated testing** of package installation and upgrades. Additionally, it daily **builds full desktop environments**, including some of community-supported variants.
