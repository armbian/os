# What this project does?

- Keeps build framework [packages artifacts](https://github.com/orgs/armbian/packages) cache up to date
- Keeps stable [apt.armbian.com](https://apt.armbian.com) and nightly [beta.armbian.com](https://beta.armbian.com) packages repository up to date
- Builds [nighly](https://github.com/armbian/os/releases) and [stable images](https://www.armbian.com/download/) and upload them to Armbian CDN
- Keep synhronising selection of [3rd party](external) applications with Armbian repositories
- Tests install of all packages that are added on stable and testing Debian and Ubuntu releases

# When this is happening?

- artifacts cache and images are updating at least once per day, at 0:00 AM UTC
- repository update is updating once per day, at 3:00 AM UTC
- manually, when Armbian member executes build action

# Missing stable or nightly images for your board?

Armbian build system includes large number of build configurations, but we are not producing all possible build options for all images. Only most popular ones gets everything, while others gets bare minimum, some nothing at all. Primary reason for lack of images is lack of human resources - [maintainers](https://docs.armbian.com/Board_Maintainers_Procedures_and_Guidelines/) - who can help keeping them operational. 

In order to enable board that exists in [build configurations](https://github.com/armbian/build/tree/main/config/boards), edit [this file](targets/default.conf) and send a pull request. Configuration file is self explanatory.

# Import 3rd party package into Armbian

We don't want to include 3rd party and Personal Package Archives (PPAs) repository components within official release but 
in some cases more recent or different versions can be added from private or testing repisotories. For security and features reasons.

Automation at Pull Request will:

- download packages from repository, direct or from GitHub releases
- place package into specific release or component, or everywhere
- execute **test install on all distributions** where it can be installed

In order to add a package into auto-sync, you need to add GPG formated repository key (when you mirror from repository) to `externel/keys` generate configuration file in folder `external`
